= Golang Tutorial 

. Java quick but too complex 
. Python easy but slow and locked in an interpreter
. C++ legacy issues and compile time is slow

New requirements highly parallel and scalable systems.

== Go (Golang)

. Strong and statically typed
. Compiled language, but fast
. Key features:
  * First simplicity (is a feature) 
  * Fast compilation times (design-build-test-loop)
  * Garbage collected language 
  * Built-in concurrency support (goroutines and channels)
  * Compile to standalone binaries (!!! no dependencies -> version management at runtime is easy)
. Excellent community support
